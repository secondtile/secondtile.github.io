clear the field by removing every tile. You do this by clicking on groups (or "clusters") of at least two same-colored tiles.

<p><b>Quick Tip:</b> Right-click anywhere on the field to access the game menu.<p>

<h4 class="blue">Earning and Using Points</h4>
<span>When you clear groups larger than two tiles, you earn <b>points</b>. These points are shown in the top bar and can be used for <b>special actions</b>: either to remove a single tile or to create a path.</span>

<img src='remove.png' class="image" height="200" width="350" onmouseover="this.src='remove.gif';" onmouseout="this.src='remove.png';" />

<h4  class="blue">Difficulty settings:</h4>

<p>Form And Fall offers various difficulty levels that change how points work:</p>

<ul><b>1: Unlimited Points</b> - Points accumulate infinitely with every cluster you clear.</ul>
<ul><b>2: Color-Restricted Removes</b> - You can only use points to remove tiles of the same color as your last cleared cluster.</ul>
<ul><b>3: Color-Limited Max Points</b> - Your maximum points are capped by the number of different colors currently on the field.</ul>
<ul><b>4: Limited Points & Removes</b> - Combines the restrictions of difficulty 2 (removes limited by last cluster's color) and difficulty 3 (max points limited by colors).</ul>
<ul><b>5: No Points</b> - You won't earn any points for removing tiles.</ul>

<h4>Understanding Paths:</h4>

<p><b>Paths</b> allow you to connect tiles and create larger clusters for bigger clears. While paths themselves don't contribute to your score and are marked by dotted tiles, they are a powerful tool!</p>
 <p>In "active" mode, each path cost 1 point. While "unlocked" its free.</p>

<img src='paths.png' class="image" height="200" width="350" onmouseover="this.src='paths.gif';" onmouseout="this.src='paths.png';" />

<h4>To create a path:</h4>

   <ul>1: Click an empty space next to a tile.</ul>
   <ul>2: Then, click another empty space next to a tile of the same color.</ul>
   <ul>3: If a route exists between them, a path will automatically generate.</ul>

 <p>You can also click the selector on a tile to "lock" either the start or end point of your path. This lets you experiment with different routes or even switch colors to plan your moves.</p>

<h4>Special Tiles</h4>
Some levels feature unique tiles:
<p><b>Fixed Tiles:</b> These tiles will not fall, but you don't need to clear them to win, but strategizing around them is key.</p>

<img src='fixedtiles.png' class="image" height="200" width="350" onmouseover="this.src='fixedtiles.gif';" onmouseout="this.src='fixedtiles.png';" />

<p><b>Locked Tiles:</b> These tiles do fall but cannot be directly removed. However, you can convert them into regular tiles if they are above a marked line, or at any time if you've set them to "unlocked" in the game options.</p>

<img src='permtiles.png' class="image" height="200" width="350" onmouseover="this.src='permtiles.gif';" onmouseout="this.src='permtiles.png';" />
